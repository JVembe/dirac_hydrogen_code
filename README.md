# dirac_hydrogen_code
Parallelized simulation code to model the interaction between a hydrogen atom and a high intensity laser pulse at relativistic energies.

Currently, MPI implementation is only performed for the matrix-vector products S\*v H0\*v and the dipole version of HI\*v in the Dirac equation. I am working on the nondipole implementation.
